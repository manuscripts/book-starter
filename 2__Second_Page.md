Here are a couple more examples of markdown elements. Here we have a blockquote:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it
> as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with
> tags or formatting instructions. 
>
> -- John Gruber

And a numbered list:

1. Numbered Item 1
2. Numbered Item 2
3. Numbered Item 3

And a code block (with syntax highlighting).

```yaml
title: Your Book Title Here
author:
  name:  Your Name Here
year:  2016
```

And a horizontal rule.

* * *

This is far from comprehensive.
